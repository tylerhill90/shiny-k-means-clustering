# K-means Clustering Shiny App

This project is currently under development and the purpose of it is to learn how to use R Shiny by creating a simple Shiny app to show k-means clustering.

At first I will use the built kmeans() function from the stats package but ultimately I would like to implement k-means in my own function.
