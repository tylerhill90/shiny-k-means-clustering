# K-means Clustering Shiny App

This project is currently under development. The purpose of it is to learn the basics of R Shiny by creating a simple app to show k-means clustering.

At first I will use the built-in kmeans() function from the stats package but ultimately I would like to implement my own k-means clustering algorithm.
